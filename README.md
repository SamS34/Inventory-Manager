## 🧠 Optional AI & OCR Setup     (NON TESTED)
The app works perfectly with its built-in tools. For even more powerful results, you can connect to external services.

> Enter your API keys in **Settings → Advanced Settings & APIs** inside the app. The app uses a fallback system, trying each service in order until it gets a result.
