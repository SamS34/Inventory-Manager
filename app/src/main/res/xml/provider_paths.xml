    This tag maps the app's internal cache directory (Context.getCacheDir()) to the FileProvider.
    The file path you are trying to share:
    /data/data/com.samuel.inventorymanager/cache/captured_image_...jpg

    The <cache-path> tag ensures that the FileProvider recognizes files placed in the 'cache' folder.
    'path="/"' means the entire cache folder and all its contents are accessible.

    <!--
    This maps the app's external files directory, which is good practice to keep
    if you ever switch from using the internal cache to the external storage for temporary files.
